# Multi-Agentic_LLM_Applications_for_Travel_Recommendation_Systems.

"Multi-Agentic LLM Applications for Travel Recommendation Systems". This innovative system leverages multiple autonomous agents to provide a comprehensive travel planning experience. By integrating advanced AI models and automation, the system simplifies decision-making for travelers and offers personalized recommendations.

## Key Features:

Our system employs specialized agents working collaboratively to deliver end-to-end travel planning insights:

•	Flight Agent ✈️: Recommends flights based on user-defined schedules, budget constraints, and travel preferences.

•	Tourist Location Agent 🌍: Suggests must-visit cultural, spiritual, and tourist destinations.

•	Location History Agent 🏛️: Provides historical background and context for selected travel destinations.

•	Hotel Agent 🏨: Finds hotels that match user preferences for location, price range, and amenities.

•	Weather Agent 🌦️: Delivers accurate weather forecasts to optimize travel planning.

•	Restaurant Agent 🍽️: Recommends highly rated restaurants based on cuisine preferences and customer reviews.

•	Local Public Transportation Agent 🚍: Suggests optimal public transportation options for easy commuting within the travel area.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to enhance the travel planning experience by automating complex decision-making processes through a multi-agent architecture. Each agent operates independently but contributes to a unified output, providing:

•	Personalized recommendations

•	Cost-effective travel options

•	Enhanced user satisfaction

## Technical Stack

•	Programming Language: Python

•	Large Language Models (LLMs): Integrated AI models for natural language processing and decision-making.

## APIs and Libraries:

•	Airline and flight search APIs

•	Weather forecasting APIs

•	Public transportation and map services.
